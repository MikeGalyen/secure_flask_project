# secure_flask_project
This repository is a project from a secure coding class (SDEV-350) at UMDGC. There is a login page that will take you to a registration page if you need to register as a new user. You can log in to get the home page where there are three links to access three profile pages for historical figures in computer science. There is a link to a change password option that will allow you to re-authenticate and then change your password. When creating a new user or changing a password, your password will first be checked against a file of common passwords and then checked against a suite of conditions that must be met to qualify as a secure password.
